# tFit
Final year project: Calorie counting application for Android.

tFit makes use of Firebase to manage how many users sign up as well as a couple
other features. The application takes user input such as age, height, weight and sex, it then
asks users how many KG they would like to lose/gain each week ranging from 0.5 â€“ 2. The
users BMI and BMR is calculated to determine recommended calorie and macro nutrients
intake in order to reach their goal. The application comes preloaded with foods in the
database, it also makes use of a barcode scanner using Firebase, so users can scan their
foods and add them to the database, it is able to determine the food name, ingredients and
macro nutrients within the foods scanned. Firebase has also made it possible for users to
reset their passwords via email. Finally, when the application is first launched users are met
with an onboarding screen which walks them through the purpose of the application and its
features
